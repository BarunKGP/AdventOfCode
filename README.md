# Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding challenge held every December following the Advent calendar. Each day a problem is released in two parts. The second part is revealed when you complete the first. Depending on how you implemented the first part, you might be in for a world of pain when solving the second part, or it might be a breeze. The two parts are usually closely related problems. There is a leaderboard and the fastest solutions wins 100 points, with the awarded points decreasing by one for each successive submission, until the fastest 100 submissions have been awarded.


Advent of Code is an outlet for me to experiment with different olutions without necessarily caring about speed or optimizations. Sometimes, it is rather exciting to just dive into problems and solve them. Sometimes it is an opportunity to try new approaches and languages. All in all, it is great fun, and a good learning experience. This repo contains my solutions to these problems for each year, starting in 2023.

There are a few helpful files here :
- `init_aoc.sh` intializes an `aoc{day}` directory for each day of Advent of Code, following the structure of my projects
- `aoctemplate.py` is my main file where I code up my solutions. `init_aoc.sh` copies this to the current day's directory and renames it accordingly
- `config.py` contains some config helpers to set up projects

Each `aoc{day}` repository contains my code for that day's problem. They usually follow the same directory structure and most of them are created using the scripts. You are free to fork this repo and use the scripts for your own Advent of Code journey if you find this helpful :)
